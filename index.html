                <p class="left">Hi, I’m Jenna Ryan and I am a creative designer from the East Coast now based in Southern California. I have been expanding my design skills which include fashion, graphic and textile design to include visual design and a knowledge of web development.</p>
                <p class="left">I am a physically active person which is why my love of fitness and my career in fashion design intersected perfectly and led me to design activewear. I enjoy researching, creating and testing functional clothing with problem solving solutions for real people.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the pages I coded by hand using a Photoshop design comp as reference. The links were set up for additional webpages, and I used CSS to link fonts and create the layout. Practice makes perfect.</p>

                    <p>This was the first project I created by hand using CSS and HTML5 following a practice design comp. I took my practice one step further and started replacing the fictional information with my own information as well as original photos and graphics. Combining my extensive knowledge of design including programs like Adobe CC has helped me immensely.</p>
